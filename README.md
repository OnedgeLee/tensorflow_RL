# This Repository is Reinforcement Learning Agent FramWork

We provide the example source code to implement the Reinforcement Learning(Vanilla PG, A2C, PPO, DDPG) using this framework.

The example source code is done in the representative image and vector state environment provided by openai gym.

This Repository include Vanilla PG, A2C, PPO based on Parallel Advantage Actor Critic.

However! Just use PPO in discrete action space. Just use DDPG in continuous action space!

What you have to do to research with this Repository is 'just make your own model' with approprepate input, output variable such as input, actor, critic.
